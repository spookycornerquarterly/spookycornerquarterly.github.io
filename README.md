We are an online publication designed for telling stories about the paranormal.

We are about enjoyment through storytelling. In utilizing GitHub for our work is ideal because we see ourselves as artists, both in our story telling and
in our coding. Old school, HTML/CSS is how we were first introduced to the internet, which is why these are the main two langauages in our work. 

As far is the code is concerned, take it, learn it or chop it up, if that is how you best learn as a coder be our guest. In less poetic terms we have added
the MIT License for the sake of practicality. 

In regards to our "journalism" we are really researching topics that interest us, as well as telling stories from our past with a level of fantasy. Much
of this information is from the public domain, and all photos are from free to use sources or were created by us.
